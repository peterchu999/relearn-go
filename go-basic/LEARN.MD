## Run Apps

`run.go` would have basic hello world code and the way to run the script was using

```
go run run.go
```

### package

`package` keyword in the top of the `run.go` is mean to packaged a code, so that other file could import the code from the current file.

however each project need to have `package main` as a way, so that go could know which file to run first.

### main function

`func main()` was also needed in the `package main` so that the golang could know which function would need to be execute first.

### comment

- `//` was used to comment a line.
- `/* */` was used for multiline comment
